          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> I am a political scientist and migration scholar. Since September 2023, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of religious and ethnic diversity (Göttingen, Germany).</p> 
          <p> My work focuses on migrants’ political incorporation in relation to political parties, state policies, and political behavior across Europe, Latin America, and global contexts, using both quantitative and qualitative methods.</p> 
          <p> I hold a PhD from the University of Sussex and I am a research affiliate to the research group Transnational Reltions, Democratization and Migration (TransDeM), located at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Ludwig-Maximilian-University (LMU) Munich, visiting research fellow at the Institute of Governance and Public Policy at the UAB, and the Department of Political Science and Public Law at the UAB.</p>

  <strong>Working paper:</strong> 
  <em>Who Gets a Seat at the Table? Immigrant-origin Politicians in Party Executive Roles</em>
  — <a href="#" onclick="toggleAbstract(event, 'abstract1')">abstract</a>
  <p id="abstract1" style="display:none; margin-top:8px;">Research on migrants’ political inclusion has largely focused on candidates and legislators, leaving party leadership positions underexplored. 
    This study addresses that gap by analysing migrants’ inclusion as party executives, concentrating on state-level executive committees of German parties, which oversee day-to-day operations and hold substantial power. 
    Examining how accessible these positions are to minority group members is key to understanding broader political inclusion dynamics. How prevalent are migrants in party executive positions, 
    and under what conditions do they attain them? Leveraging multiple original data sources—a unique large-N dataset covering all state-level executive committees across six parties, qualitative interviews 
    and a survey with party executives, and party documents—this study investigates the influence of three party-level factors. 
    This study shifts the focus from parliaments to the inner life of party organisations, advancing our understanding of migrants’ political inclusion.
